3 Observations from the data
1.) Both Female and Male mice were represented equally in this study. Both sexes accounted for very close to 50% of the population size with Males having slightly more subjects 
2.) Based on total timepoints recorded: The 8 drugs regimens tested were represented fairly equally. Capomulin and Ramicane had more overall timepoints recorded than any of the other drug regimens
3.) Mouse 'r554' had an overall reduction in Tumor Volume of almost 13 cubic milimeters over the course of its Capomulin Regimen, which included 10 unique time points. Only between 2 of those points did the tumor increase in volume
